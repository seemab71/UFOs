# UFOs
## Overview

This project allowed me to design a web page and build a dynamic table. The project allows a table of UFO reports based on various filter criteria. The Javascript allowed the storage of data as an array or list.  

### Results
Search criteria may be entered to filter the data table into the corresponding input field.
